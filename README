A (very) basic contact form example using Play-Mailer

https://github.com/playframework/play-mailer

Before using:

1. configure the mail server settings in application.conf - at end of file.
2. Modify the mail message in the contactSubmit() method (see HomeController.java)
3. Read the Play-Mailer docs for more configuration options (attachments, HTML email, etc.)
